bikeStationsApiProxy
====================

This ASPNET WEB API proxy acts as a bridge between the JCDecaux bike api and your client app.

You can retrieve a list of bike stations by providing your api key, the request is cached in memory for a configured time (default config is 1 minute).

Cross origin requests can also be configured, add the domain of your client app (default config is *)

This proxy is configurable for any JCDecaux bike contract so any region can by configured.
